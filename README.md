Apple or Tomato? Binary Image Classification

In this project, we will make a binary classification model that can identify whether it is an apple or a tomato in the image.
Apples and tomatoes share some common characteristics such as the round shape or the red color.
It might be a tricky work to train a model properly, so that it can differntiate the two different obejcts.

This is a basic exercise to develop a image classifier with Tensorflow. It can be used as a basic guidline to create a model from a pretrained one.
